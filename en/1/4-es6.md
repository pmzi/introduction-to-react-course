# Session 1 - Part 4: ES6 Features: Arrow Functions, let, const and template literals

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a version of JavaScript that introduced many new features to the language. Some of the most commonly used features are Arrow Functions, `let`, `const`, and Template Literals.

1.  Arrow Functions:

Arrow functions are a shorthand for writing anonymous functions in JavaScript. They have a more concise syntax compared to regular functions and are particularly useful for writing small functions.

Here's an example of using an arrow function to return the square of a number:

```js
const square = (x) => x * x;
console.log(square(2)); // Output: 4
```

In this example, the arrow function `square` takes a single argument `x` and returns its square.

2.  `let` and `const`:

`let` and `const` are two new ways to declare variables in JavaScript. The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable with block-level scope, while the `const` keyword is used to declare a constant value that cannot be reassigned.

Here's an example of using `let` to declare a variable with block-level scope:

```js
if (true) {
	let x = 2;
	console.log(x); // Output: 2 
} 
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

In this example, the variable `x` is declared using the `let` keyword and is only accessible within the block of the `if` statement.

Here's an example of using `const` to declare a constant value:

```js
const PI = 3.14;

console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14 .

PI = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

In this example, the constant value of `PI` is declared using the `const` keyword and cannot be reassigned.

3.  Template Literals:

Template literals are a new way to define string literals in JavaScript. They use backticks (\`) instead of quotes (`'` or `"`) and allow for embedding expressions inside strings.

Here's an example of using a template literal to concatenate strings and expressions:

```js
const name = 'John';
const age = 30;
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`); // Output: My name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

In this example, the template literal \`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.\`uses the \`${expression}\` syntax to embed expressions inside the string. The resulting string is then logged to the console.

These ES6 features provide a more concise and expressive way of writing JavaScript code. In the next part, we'll look at some examples of using these features in practice.
