# Session 4 - Part 1: What is React and Why Use It?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now widely used by developers around the world. 

## What is a User Interface?

A user interface (UI) is the means by which a user interacts with a computer or electronic device. This includes the layout, design, and functionality of a website, app, or software program.

## What is React?

React allows developers to build user interfaces using a component-based architecture. This means that a UI can be broken down into individual, reusable pieces called components. These components can be composed together to form larger, more complex UIs.

## Why Use React?

React has become popular among developers for several reasons:

- **Declarative:** React allows developers to describe the structure of a UI in a declarative way. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
- **Component-Based:** React's component-based architecture allows developers to build UIs using modular, reusable code.
- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to manage updates to the UI. This means that React can update the UI efficiently without needing to re-render the entire page.
- **Large Ecosystem:** React has a large ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community resources, making it easier for developers to build complex applications.

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into React's component-based architecture and how it works.
