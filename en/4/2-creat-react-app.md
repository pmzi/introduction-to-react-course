# Session 4 - Part 2: Creating a React Application

To get started with React, we'll need to create a new React application. There are a few different ways to do this, but the easiest way is to use the Create React App command-line tool.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Before we can use Create React App, we need to install Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

## Step 2: Install Create React App

Once Node.js is installed, we can use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install Create React App. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

This will install Create React App globally on your system, allowing you to create new React applications from anywhere.

## Step 3: Create a New React Application

To create a new React application, navigate to the directory where you want to create the app and enter the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace "my-app" with the name of your application. This will create a new directory called "my-app" with a basic React application inside.

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

To run the development server and see the basic React application in action, navigate into the "my-app" directory and enter the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You should see a basic React app with a spinning logo and some sample text.
