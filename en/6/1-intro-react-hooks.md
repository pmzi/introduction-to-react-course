# Session 6 - Part 1: Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

The basic idea behind hooks is to provide a more direct API to React's internal state and lifecycle mechanisms. By doing so, it allows for simpler, more reusable code, and removes the need to use class components in many cases.

One of the main benefits of hooks is that they allow you to reuse stateful logic between components. This means that you can separate concerns more easily and make your code more modular.

Another important aspect of hooks is that they all start with the word "use". This makes it easy to distinguish between normal functions and hooks, and also ensures that hooks are used correctly.

Overall, React Hooks provide a powerful new way to manage state and lifecycle in your React applications, and can make your code more efficient and easier to understand.
